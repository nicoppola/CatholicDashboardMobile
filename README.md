## Background and Motivation
### Quality Catholic Apps
While looking for Catholic apps to aid me in my prayer and Catholic life, I continuously found apps that were clunky to use, bloated with no clear purpose, difficult to navigate, and in general not a pleasent experience to use.  Two things that I found myself wanting to view on a daily basis are the readings for the day, as well as the liturgy of the hours. So I decided to create an app that would do just that.  Simple, clean, easy to use, with a clear purpose.

### Learning Kotlin Multiplatform
Additionally, as a professional Android developer who owns an iPhone, I needed a project to begin learning Kotlin Multiplatform and create apps that can be useful for myself as well as my Android friends.  The learning curve was pretty low since I used Kotlin and Compose Multiplatform, and I'm looking forward to future projects!
